  "summary": "\"While making a maneuver to reach 225 m between satellites the drift was found to be more than expected, post non-visibility period\n\n\"SpaDeX will serve as a milestone in advancing India's capabilities in space docking, a critical technology for future space missions including satellite servicing, space station operations, and interplanetary missions,\" ISRO said in an explainer\n\nA chaser and target satellite move at a speed of 28,800 kmph, or 10 times the speed of a bullet, but they appear to be stationary due to zero relative velocity\n\n\" The SpaDEX is a pivotal project, which is designed to develop and demonstrate the technology needed for spacecraft rendezvous, docking, and undocking using two small satellites, the space agency said\n\nEarlier, ISRO chief S Somanth said: \"They will do the docking exercise only when all sensors have been fully calibrated and tested to satisfaction before it is attempted",
